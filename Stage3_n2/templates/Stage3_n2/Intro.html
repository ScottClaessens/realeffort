<p>
    In Stage 3, you remain in the same group of two workers. As in Stage 2, you will complete addition questions as a
    group.
</p>
<p>
    In Stage 3, you will earn <b>{{stage3_piecerate|c}}</b> for every
    <b>{{stage3_requiredcycles}} response cycles</b> your group completes.
</p>
<p>
    Stage 3 will consist of six rounds. In these rounds, you will experience each possible chain (i.e.
    ABA-BAB or BAB-ABA) three times. Your group will be timed in each round, as before.
